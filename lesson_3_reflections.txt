When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1. If i want to share my work with others.
    2. This way i can use the remote repo as back up as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pull is always better, as i dont want anything new which might have been commited to the 
    github repo synced with my local repo till such time that i am ready pull the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: lets us clone a repo from diff account on gitHub to ur own. only on GitHub,
            add on to diff capabilities
    clones : creates a copy of a repo either on local or gitHub
             we clone when we pull a repo from gitHub
             we clone when we do a initial push to the gitHub from local
    branches : on a  single repo we can create a branch
                every time we fix a bug or add new feature or do some experiment
