How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    used Diff command on the git bash like so:
    Diff -u game_old.js game_new.js

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It lets us now what changes are made over a period of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Git gives more control, and we don't want to intermediate files checked-in
    can add information .... about the check-in.
    


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In google docs, we are mostly working with one doc at a time...
    whereas with git we might want to check-in  feature which is spread across multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log : gives a list of all check-in that have happened chronologically.
    git diff : compares any two files....and gives the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I can always revert the changes i have made... incase i break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    create a few files...
    check-in these
